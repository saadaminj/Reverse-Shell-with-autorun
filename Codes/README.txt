Client is for same pc, you have to explicity run it, it will run on background. to quit it. you have to open server.exe and enter command "quit". both will quit. if you enter "client quit", only client side will exit.

Client2 is for devices connected to same router, but the IP given is static and for the PC of Group leader, so it might not work for others.
